Some ground tules:
- self-contained module
 - everything to do with my module is in my module
 - no global variables
 - if a module manages more than one thing it should be split up
- separation of concerns
- DRY code: Don't Repeat Yourself
- efficient DOM usage
 - very few $(selections)
- no memeory leaks
 - all events can be unbound
